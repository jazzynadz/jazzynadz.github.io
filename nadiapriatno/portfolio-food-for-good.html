                        <p>We all aware that many people are infected with corona virus, and suffer from mobility limitations while doing self isolation. Food for Good is present as a multi-device e-commerce app that helps self-isolating citizens to find budget-friendly catering services during the Covid-19 pandemic. Food for Good strives to help users find caterer based on budget and ease of delivery, while also enables other people to donate to their prefered caterer.</p>

                        <p>Food for Good’s primary users include corona positive citizens who are doing self isolation, especially those whose income are greatly reduced during the lock down. These users are those who currently have budget and mobility limitations, but on the other hand really need access to healthy food to help them get well.</p>

                        <p>We conducted user research and received feedback from users that we turned into user personas. One of our user personas, Wisnu, is a 22-year fresh graduate who lives by himself in a rented low- budget boarding room because his family lives in another city. When diagnosed with corona positive, Wisnu is frustated because he has to provide everything with limitations, since he hasn’t got any job yet. The research revealed that besides of budget-friendly meals, Wisnu feels greatly helped by free delivery services.</p>

                        <p>We sketched out some concepts for our app's design based on what we learned about our users using the Crazy 8's approach. We rapidly brainstormed multiple creative solutions based on what we learned from our research to identify various ways we could begin designing.</p>

All of these provide a simplified and intuitive means of navigation for the user.</p>

                        <p>In this version, the digital wireframes from the previous step were connected together into a working prototype. That meant users were able to interact with each part of the design and test the way it worked. In this example, we demonstrate how the various wireframes that make up the pages of our design fit together when each element becomes interactive.</p>

                        <p>Our goal was to figure out what difficulties users encountered when trying to complete the core task in the Food for Good app, which is finding a budget-friendly caterer, then subscribe a meal plan and complete the payment.</p>
                        <p>We conducted a remote, unmoderated usability study between July 1-10. We tasked 5 participants with browsing nearby caterers, select a caterer then subscribe a meal plan. Each session lasted about 30-60 minutes, including the test and interview questions.
                        <p>Participants were anyone concerned about finding budget-friendly foods during the pandemic. Members of the testing group were from urban and suburban areas. We included a balanced number of male, female, and nonbinary participants, all of whom were aged 18 to 65 years old. We presented participants with a series of tasks that had them interact with the core tasks in the app. We recorded the sessions and took notes on their progress and feedback.</p>

                        <p>At this point in the design cycle, we began to add colors, images, and icons to our designs. We updated the shape, size, and structure of content borders and sections to high-fidelity versions. We also implemented the feedback we received during usability testing in order to improve the user experience. To do this, we add an alternative way to browse the caterer in grid format, we add caterer's profile page where users can preview the caterer's info and reviews, and also add the order confirmation page before proceeding to payment.</p>

                        <p>We then moved from designing to prototyping to create our hi-fi prototype.

Each page of the design reflected the changes we made as a result of usability testing, and worked exactly like the real app would. This is what we presented to stakeholders and passed off to the development team for production.</p>
